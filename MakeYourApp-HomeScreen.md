ðŸ’¡ Choosing a theme means, that we have a predefined and harmonized set of colors in our app. Of course we can tweak this later on or define our own colors, but this is the fastest and easiest way. 

## Welcome Message

* Click `Insert`
* Click `Label`

A textbox appears. This textbox - as everything in our Power App, has properties, which you can find in two areas: 

1. Sidebar on the left - watch out, it has two tabs- `Properties` and `Advanced` and can sometimes be a bit confusing
2. Dropdown menu at the top - I prefer to set properties right here.

Write a text in your Textbox like "Welcome to the conference"
