  ## Power Platform License
  
  As we need a Premium Connector (Common Data Services) in our App, we will need a License to cover this scenario. For this please follow the process for [Signing up for Community Plan](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/communityplan/). Community Plan is a free Power Apps License which is intended for learning but not for production. You can use it in this Bootcamp and for your ongoing learning journey.
