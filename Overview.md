# Overview (you are here üìç)

## What do we want to build? 

In this hands-on lab we want to make a Power App which should be an app for attendees of a conference.

### Features

* show list of sessions,
* rate sessions and submit this feedback,
* monitor a hashtag on twitter.

### Data Model & connectors

As we use different data sources to make this app, it is a good idea to understand the data model first. 

#### Outputs

* Sessions come from an Outlook calendar, we will use the Office 365 Outlook connector to get events
* tweets come from twitter, we will use the twitter connector

(as we don't want to rebuild a whole twitter client in Power Apps, we will just read tweets and add a feature to open twitter on web / app to like, reply, retweet

#### Inputs

session ratings shall be posted into a CDS entity

### Screens

* Home Screen,
* Sessions Screen,
* Session Ratings Screen,
* Twitter Screen
* Success Screen
