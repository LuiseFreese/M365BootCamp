# Overview (you are here üìç)

## What do we want to build? 

In this hands-on lab we want to make a Power App which should be an app for attendees of a conference.

### Features

* show list of sessions,
* rate sessions and submit this feedback,
* monitor a hashtag on twitter.

### Data Model & connectors

As we use different data sources to make this app, it is a good idea to understand the data model first. 

#### Outputs

* Sessions come from an Outlook calendar, we will use the Office 365 Outlook connector to get events
* tweets come from twitter, we will use the twitter connector

(as we don't want to rebuild a whole twitter client in Power Apps, we will just read tweets and add a feature to open twitter on web / app to like, reply, retweet

#### Inputs

session ratings shall be posted into a CDS entity

### Screens

* Home Screen,
* Sessions Screen,
* Session Ratings Screen,
* Twitter Screen
* Success Screen

## What do you need to get started? 

To be able to build this app, you will need the following:

* Microsoft Developer Tenant,

* Power Apps License, which can be: 

    * Community Plan (free,
  
    * 30 day free trial. 

* Twitter Account

## How do we navigate the different tenants?

As we do the Bootcamp in the Microsoft Community Events tenant and you do the lab in your developer tenant (and you will probably need/want to have your main work tenant open as well) it is a good idea to have different profiles in your browser for the different tenants.
